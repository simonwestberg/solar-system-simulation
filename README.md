# solar-system-simulation

In this project I implement a simulation of our solar system and study the behavior of an asteroid passing close by Jupiter. Three different numerical integrators were studied in terms
of energy conservation â€“ Euler, Euler-Cromer, and velocity Verlet. The project was done as a final project in the course SI1336 Simulation and Modeling at KTH.
