# solar-system-simulation

In this project I implemented a simulation of our solar system and studied the behavior of an asteroid passing close by Jupiter. Three different numerical integrators were studied in terms
of energy conservation â€“ Euler, Euler-Cromer, and velocity Verlet. The project was done as a final project in the course SI1336 Simulation and Modeling at KTH. A summary of the used methods and results can be found [here](results.pdf).

Below is a short GIF showing 200 days of a simulation of the inner and outer solar system based on the velocity Verlet method.

The below GIF shows a simulation of the solar system with an added asteroid that passes close by Jupiter, changing its trajectory.
